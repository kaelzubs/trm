          <h4>1. Shipping Policy</h4>
          <p>
            {{ store_name }} operates on a dropshipping model. This means your order is shipped
            directly from our suppliers to your address. Delivery times may vary depending on
            supplier location and your destination country.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Processing time:</strong> Orders are typically processed within 2–5 business days.</li>
            <li><strong>Estimated delivery:</strong> 7–21 business days depending on location.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Tracking numbers are provided once available.</li>
            <li><strong>Customs & duties:</strong> Customers are responsible for any applicable import duties or taxes.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>2. Delays</h4>
          <p>
            While we strive to meet estimated delivery times, delays may occur due to customs,
            local postal services, or unforeseen supplier issues. We are not liable for delays
            outside our control.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Return Policy</h4>
          <p>
            We want you to be satisfied with your purchase. If you receive a defective or damaged
            item, you may request a return within {{ return_window_days }} days of delivery.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Items must be unused and in original packaging.</li>
            <li>Return requests must be approved by our support team before shipping items back.</li>
            <li>Customers are responsible for return shipping costs unless the item is defective.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>4. Refunds</h4>
          <p>
            Once your return is received and inspected, we will notify you of the approval or
            rejection of your refund. Approved refunds will be processed to your original payment
            method within 5–10 business days.
          </p>

          <h4>5. Exchanges</h4>
          <p>
            We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need an exchange,
            please contact us at <a href="mailto:{{ support_email }}">{{ support_email }}</a>.
